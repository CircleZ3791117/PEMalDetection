This is a project which can identify whether a PE file is malicious or not using machine learning.

In this project, I will test the effect of different machine learning models like DecisonTree, RandomForest, etc.

This project focus on static analysis of malware.

In the future work, i'm going to add dynamic features and try to utilize deep learning methods.

In the production environment we are going to use Spark.
